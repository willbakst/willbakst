# Hello, world!

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

The [`mirascope`](https://github.com/Mirascope/mirascope) open-source library. I'm hoping to make the most (in my opinion :smile:) delightful and pythonic tools for building LLM applications. The library is in it's infancy, so any and all help, feedback, and suggestions are welcome with open arms!

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...

How to build a Chrome Extension. If you have any suggestions for awesome tooling that makes this easier, let me know!

## ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...

Bananas. I love bananas. And their lore...

## âš¡ Fun fact:

Baleen whales communicate using the Deep Sound Channel (or SOFAR channel), which is a naturally-occuring phenomenon in the ocean that enables sound to travel greater distances without distortion due to oceanic properties.
